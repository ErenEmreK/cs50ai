# CS50AI 
As a fan of Harvard's CS50 and CS50P courses, i felt obliged to take CS50's 'Introduction to Artificial Intelligence' too, since this course is big of a step up from where its ancestors left, it can be pretty challenging to figure things out at first, especially for beginners like i was. So i'm leaving it here in case it helps someone. 

Bonne chance.
